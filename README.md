Data Analysis and Visualization for WatchDataCase

Objective:

The objective of this project is to perform data analysis, visualization, and prediction on a dataset related to watch data. 

The system will use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to achieve this.

Description:

This project aims to analyze and visualize a dataset containing various watch-related data points, including Max Pulse, Average Pulse, Hours Work, Hours Sleep, Calorie Burnage, and more. 

The system will perform data cleaning, visualization, and prediction tasks to understand the relationships between these variables and make predictions about calorie burnage based on average pulse input.

Features:

Data Import and Cleaning: The project imports a CSV file containing watch data using Pandas and cleans it by removing missing values.

Data Visualization: The system uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots and heatmaps to visualize the relationships between various variables, including correlation matrices and scatter plots.

Prediction: The project uses linear regression to fit a line to the relationship between average pulse and calorie burnage and creates a prediction function to estimate calorie burnage based on input average pulse values.
